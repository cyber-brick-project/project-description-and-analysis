\section{Introduction}

Cyber Brick Project was stared out of dreams of young boy. Dreams of better, bigger and more
complex creations, buildings, machines. Finally, whole cities, with working infrastructure.

These dreams were getting stronger after visiting Lego exhibitions, where such cities exist. But,
while such masterpieces were amazing, most of them had no life in them. Sometimes simple electric
engines were giving constant or repetitive motions. Like simulation of life.

Meanwhile, discovering models with remote controllers, gave hope, yet required person to
operate it all manually. And suddenly, there was pure revelation: ``AlmightyArjen''\footnote{
More details can be found at: \Uurl{http://www.almightyarjen.com/}}. Especially ``HUGE Lego train
coal terminal fully automated by Arduino''\footnote{ Youtubue video:

While admiring AlmightyArjen's works, one common thing can be spotted. Most (if not all) trains
are powered from rails.
